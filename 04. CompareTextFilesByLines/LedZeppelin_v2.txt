And as we wind on down the road 
 Our shadows taller than our souls 
 There walks a lady we all know 
 Who shines white light and wants to show 
 How everything still turns to gold

 And if you listen very hard 

 The tune will come to you at last 

 When all is one and one is all 
 
 To be a rock and not to roll"
