We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. 
It was very quiet there. 
At night sometimes the roll of the drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of day ... 
The dawn were heralded by a chill stillness; 
the wood-cutters slept, their fires burned low;
the snapping of a twig would make you start.
We were wanderers on a prehistoric planet ... 
But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roof, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droops of heavy and motionless foliage. 
Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness
