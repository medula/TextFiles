 [Chris Brown:]
  Meanest  Meaner  Second I seen her
 got me open Got Me looking Losing all my Control
   I'm feinin
 Baby You're  new Meaning
 But I Found Myself Tripping When You Walked Through  Door
 and I no It's not like me getting beside Myself She's Got Me Filling That Way
 And I know It's not Likely That You're Gonna Deny Me And Just Walk Away

[Hook:]
 I'll Be That Guy That don't Have Time To Play,
 something Like a Schedule but it's about the same
  Ballers In  corner are Ready For your Game
 It's looking Like your neck Are Ready For My Chain
 She'll Be That  I'll Be Waiting For
 Sending me them Signals That I Can't Ignore
 thought I was gonna Get  On  Dancefloor
 n I Saw  Head To  Exit Door

[Chorus:]
 Call   'cause She's Got It,
 Do It Whatever Whenever 'cause She's about It
 that deer  'cause I Got It Do It Whatever Whenever 'cause I'm about It
 I'm Falling For , She's Got Me Trap
 That  Is  'cause She's Got, She's Got It, She's Got It, Breathe, Breathe

[Verse]
 her body is Screaming
 I Think That She's Missing
 Ain't saying What You're Saying I'm Loosing My Cool
 You Picture A Soldier now I Got Me A Rider
 And You Ain't Got To Stress you 'cause It's Nothing To Prove
 I Know It Ain't Easy Being A Sexy  that's Always Getting In  Way
 But I'm Gonna Tell you
 You Got Me Up On you
 And I Won't Slip Away

[Hook 1x]
[Chorus 1x]

[ Game:]

 All My Chris Out  Bitches Are Too Hot
  Taking re Clothes Off
  yelling At Tupac
 'cause I'm From  West-Side
 And  From  East-Coast
 My Niggas From Down-South  Letting re teeth-Show
 'cause This Ain't Def Jam And This Ain't Bad Boy
 This Ain't Star Trek This Is  Last Court y Turning  Lights On
  Bar Is Shot Down I'm Walking With Scott Storch
 And We In  Frunt Now Whatmacher Seen You're friends
 You're Gonna Get Knocked Off We Happen In 6.4
 'cause This about  Get Down
 (it's going down)

[Chris Brown:]
 Call   'cause She's Got It,
 Do It Whatever Whenever 'cause She's about It
 Got That  'cause I Got It
 Do It Whatever Whenever 'cause I'm about It
 I'm Falling For  She's Got Me Trap That  Is
